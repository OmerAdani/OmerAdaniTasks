          Passion fruit, known scientifically as Passiflora edulis, is a tropical fruit that boasts a distinctive appearance, captivating both in its vibrant colours and unique shape. The fruit itself is small to medium-sized, with a round or oval shape. Its outer skin is firm and smooth, ranging in colour from vibrant purple or deep maroon to bright yellow. Some varieties even feature a combination of colours, creating a visually stunning exterior.

        Passion fruit is a rich source of dietary fibre. Fibre helps in keeping the digestive system properly functioning and is responsible for keeping gut health intact. 

        People with bowel disorders and constipation are advised to eat foods rich in fibre. This is because research proves that fibre helps make the stool softer, allowing for easy bowel movements. 
        
        Furthermore, studies show that fibre is also beneficial in boosting heart health by reducing cholesterol. Since it doesn’t contain any sterols, it is a great fruit for people who have heart conditions.

          Scoop out the passion fruit pulp with a spoon and place it in a bowl. You can also enjoy passion fruit pulp straight from the shell. All you'll need is a spoon! Try sprinkling a little of your favorite sweetener onto the pulp to cut the tartness.

          Passion fruit grows to the size of a tennis ball and can be oval or round. The fruit varies from purple to yellow or orange and features a thick protective rind of about a quarter inch. Inside the rind, numerous seeds are covered in a sweet-acidic pulp, both of which can be consumed.

                      Turn your classic lemon curd into a delicious tropical treat with sweet-tart passion fruit. It's the perfect low-carb filling for summer pies.

                        I definitely have a soft spot for tropical fruit in my recipes. Just a quick glance around and you’ll find mango everywhere, like my healthy mango crepes or chocolate mango chia pudding. It’s sweet and good for you. What’s not to love?

                          The mere mention of passionfruit alone could send you into a trance that places you on the islands of a vast tropical oasis — or at least someplace with sunshine and a body of water. While passionfruit may be best known as a juice, it typically has deep purple or red-colored outer rinds that withhold their bright yellow jammy centers, according to Food Print. Their surprisingly sweet and tart flavor makes them the star of a range of beverages and foods that add a tropical twist to your everyday indulgences.
